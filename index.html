				Hammer Tools is a series of in-browser tools, designed to automate certain tasks for Valve's Hammer Editor software.
				The end product of these tools is a VMF file, which can either be used as a prefab and inserted into the original map, or can be opened directly and copied into the original map.
				These tools have only been tested on the TF2 branch of Hammer++ (which should work with the default TF2 branch of Hammer Editor). 
				Any other version has not been tested, and is not guaranteed to work.
